## Installation

Wow, what helpful installation instructions.

```
gem install yada-yada-dont-actually-run-this-please
```

## Basic Usage

We're not quite there yet. Get off my back, brah. It'll work something like this though:

```
serinette orchestrate
```

Alternatively you can pass serinette a list of amazing flags and arguments and stuff (you can't)

```
serinette orchestrate --wow -f me
```

For more details check the available command-line options (none of these work at all, please just go away):

```
serinette -h
```

Command flag              | Description
--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
`-v/--version`            | Displays the current version and exits.
`-V/--verbose-version`    | Displays the current version plus the version of Parser and Ruby.
`-d/--debug`              | Displays some extra debug output.
`-f/--format`             | Choose a formatter.
